# High order lambdas

## Why?

High order lambdas abstract the code responsibilities to a higher level, by injecting parameters into your lambda context object, so you just have to care about the business logic of your lambda.

- Code responsibilities well defined
- Reduces the number of lines of code
- Helpers and utils such as validation, logs, etc... available in the lambda context
